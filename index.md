I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about myself.
My name is Shahidullah khan. I have been working in IT field since May 1, 2006. 
In my professional life I have worked on different projects, tools & technologies. Initially i have started my career as a Quality Assurance Engineer and in the first 8 years mostly working on manuall testing. I always want to be a software developer but after working so many years as a QA it was difficult for me to change the field. Luckily I got the chance in my company to develop an automation framework.
